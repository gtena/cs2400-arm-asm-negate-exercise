Question 1. UAL stands for Universal Assembly Language
Question 2. The short program is changing the array in the memory, while the long version is changing it in the stack
Question 3. In the longer version, the array is created on the stack. The compiler generated generic code based off 
            general arm assembly.
Question 4. You can use malloc to allocate memory on the heap and use pointers to change the values,
            or it might be possible to assign the array as a global variable.
